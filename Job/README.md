# Jobs

##### Things to try out

- What happens if Pod spec consists of multiple containers? what is the use case for this? Does containers run in the order?
- is there a way to control the commands/utilities/programs which are passed to the job with completions? As in a job defined with 3 completions. each run would be for different purpose.
